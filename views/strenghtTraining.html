      <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Effective Strength Training Exercises</h2>
      <p class="text-base md:text-lg mb-4">Here are some essential exercises to help you build muscle and strength. These exercises can be performed at home or in the gym, using minimal or advanced equipment.</p>
      <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6">
        <div class="p-4 bg-white shadow rounded">
          <h3 class="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold">Push-Ups</h3>
          <p>Start in a plank position with hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Lower your body until your chest nearly touches the ground, then push back up. This exercise targets the chest, shoulders, and triceps.</p>
          <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-600">Tip: To increase difficulty, try clapping push-ups or placing your feet on an elevated surface.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="p-4 bg-white shadow rounded">
          <h3 class="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold">Squats</h3>
          <p>Stand with feet shoulder-width apart and lower your hips back and down as if sitting into a chair. Keep your chest up and knees aligned with your toes. Return to standing. Squats strengthen the legs, glutes, and core.</p>
          <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-600">Tip: For added resistance, hold dumbbells or a barbell across your shoulders.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="p-4 bg-white shadow rounded">
          <h3 class="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold">Deadlifts</h3>
          <p>Stand with feet hip-width apart, holding a barbell or dumbbells in front of you. With a slight bend in your knees, hinge at the hips and lower the weights while keeping your back straight. Return to standing. Deadlifts work the hamstrings, glutes, and lower back.</p>
          <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-600">Tip: Keep your core engaged and your back straight to avoid injury.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="p-4 bg-white shadow rounded">
          <h3 class="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold">Dumbbell Shoulder Press</h3>
          <p>Sit or stand with a dumbbell in each hand, elbows bent at a 90-degree angle. Press the weights overhead until arms are fully extended. Lower back to the starting position. This exercise strengthens the shoulders and triceps.</p>
          <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-600">Tip: Perform seated shoulder presses to reduce the strain on your lower back.</p>

      <p class="text-base md:text-lg mb-4">To maximize the benefits and ensure safety during your strength training sessions, consider the following tips:</p>
      <ul class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">

        <li>Start with lighter weights and focus on perfecting your form before increasing weight.</li>
        <li>Allow sufficient rest between workouts to give your muscles time to recover and grow.</li>
        <li>Stay hydrated and maintain a balanced diet with enough protein to support muscle repair and growth.</li>
        <li>Keep your training routine varied to prevent plateaus and engage different muscle groups.</li>
        <li>Consider working with a trainer or using instructional videos to learn proper techniques and avoid injuries.</li>

        <li>Incorporate compound exercises to target multiple muscle groups at once for more efficient training.</li>
        <li>Listen to your body; if you feel pain (not just discomfort), stop and assess your form or take a rest day.</li>
